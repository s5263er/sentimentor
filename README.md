In this project I'm planning to create a web app using ASP.NET and RapidAPI(Sentiment Analysis of Stocks) to keep track of 
bullish/bearish stocks according to Reddit and Twitter sentiment analysis. I might extend this project in the future. I forgot to add a commit message
The first commit -m "Data was retrieved successfully from RapidAPI and passed to the front-end."
